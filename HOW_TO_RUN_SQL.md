## How to start managing MySQL database from the command line

First of all, we need to create a user. For this, we run the following command:

`CREATE USER 'username' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';`

Donâ€™t forget to replace the username and password placeholders with a username and password of your choice.

Keep in mind, that just creating a user is not enough, you need to grant certain privileges to this user. For this, run the MySQL query:

`GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'username';`

This explicitly grants only the SELECT permission for the specified user. In case you want to grant a user all permissions on all databases, run the following command:

`GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'username';.`
