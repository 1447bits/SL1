### DBMS 1

SQL Queries:
 Design and Develop SQL DDL statements which demonstrate the use of
SQL objects such as Table, View, Index, Sequence, Synonym, different
constraints etc.
 Write at least 10 SQL queries on the suitable database application using
SQL DML statements.

### DBMS 2

SQL Queries – all types of Join, Sub-Query and View:
Write at least10 SQL queries for suitable database application using SQL DML
statements. Note: Instructor will design the queries which demonstrate the use
of concepts like all types of Join ,Sub-Query and View

### DBMS 3

MongoDB Queries:
Design and Develop MongoDB Queries using CRUD operations. (Use CRUD
operations, SAVE method,

### DBMS 4

Unnamed PL/SQLcode block: Use of Control structure and Exception handling
is mandatory.

Suggested Problem statement:

Consider Tables:
1. Borrower (Roll_no, Name, Date_of_Issue, Name_of_Book, Status)
2. Fine (Roll_no, Date, Amt)
    Accept Roll_no and Name_of_Book from user.
    Check the number of days (from Date_of_Issue).
    If days are between 15 to 30 then fine amount will be Rs 5per day.
    If no. of days>30, per day fine will be Rs 50 per day and for days less than 30, Rs. 5 per day.
    After submitting the book, status will change from I to R.
    If condition of fine is true, then details will be stored into fine table.
    Also handles the exception by named exception handler or user define exception handler.

(OR)

MongoDB – Aggregation and Indexing: Design and Develop MongoDB
Queries using aggregation and indexing with suitable example using
MongoDB.
MongoDB – Map-reduce operations: Implement Map-reduce operation
with suitable example using MongoDB.

### DBMS 5

Cursors: (All types: Implicit, Explicit, Cursor FOR Loop, Parameterized Cursor)
Write a PL/SQL block of code using parameterized Cursor that will merge the
data available in the newly created table N_Roll_Call with the data available in
the table O_Roll_Call. If the data in the first table already exists in the second
table then that data should be skipped.

### DBMS 6

Database Connectivity:
Write a program to implement MySQL/Oracle database connectivity with any
front end language to implement Database navigation operations (add, delete,
